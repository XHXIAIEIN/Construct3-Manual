## Overview

A player in your game can choose to set or update the email address of their account with this end point.  Email addresses must be in a valid email format, and must be unique across all players in your game.  If the email address provided is already in use by another player, you will receive an error response.

If your plan supports it, an email will be sent to this player asking them to click a link to verify their email address.  Only verified emails can use the email sign in method.  If your plan does not support emails, the email address will be set for the player but will remain in an unverified state.

## Request URL

All parameters in the request must be sent as a `POST` HTTP request.  Make all requests to the following URL:

```none
