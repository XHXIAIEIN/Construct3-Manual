## Overview

Deleting a player removes them from your game completely, and deletes all associated data from all other Construct Game Services in your game such as leaderboard scores, cloud saves etc.  Deletion is completely irreversible.

It's important to ensure that you give players the option to delete themselves for privacy reasons.

Once deleted, requests for this specific player ID will immediately start failing due to the player being deleted, however you may notice other data in Construct Game Services for this player may take a short period of time to be deleted.  The length of time to fully delete the player and their data will depend on how much they have interacted with other game services and how busy the CGS servers currently are.  It is safe to assume all their data will be fully deleted within 24 hours.
